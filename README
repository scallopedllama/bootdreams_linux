Bootdreams dot py is a python re-write of the windows tool bootdreams used to burn CDs
for use with the Sega Dreamcast console. Bootdreams is strictly intended for homebrew and educational
purposes and is not to be used for piracy. It uses the tools cdirip and nerorip to extract track data
from CDI and NRG images then uses cdrecord to burn that track data to a CD.

The curent version of bootdreams.py is only capable of burning Nero and Discjuggler images. It does nothing
special to make them work for the Dreamcast, relying on the disc images being "selfbooting" to accomplish that.
As such, for now bootdreams.py is simply a CDI / NRG image burning tool.

Bootdreams.py depends on cdirip and nerorip to properly burn those types of images.
For your convenience, they are provided with this program and to install them, all you need to do is run
  $ make
and then
  $ make install 
as a superuser from the root bootdreams directory.

Future versions of bootdreams.py will hopefully have the following features:
 - Automatic detection of non-selfbooting images to make the selfbooting
 - Support for ISO and BIN/CUE images where they are made selfbooting
 - Support for burning folders and making that image selfbooting
 - Support for Alcohol 120% image format (Will take a while, will have to write a tool like nerorip)
 
My tests of Bootdreams.py have produced no failed burns with the current version.
If you come across an image that will not burn properly, please report it to the issues queue:
