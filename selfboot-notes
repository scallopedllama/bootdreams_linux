Seems general selfboot procedure should go as follows:
Convert bin/cue to isos and audio files.
  If there are audio files. make it a data/data selfbooting disc
  otherwise make it an audio/data selfboot disc

For audio/data discs:
  1. Burn the raw audio track to the first session
  2. Extract the iso(s)
  3. Check for an IP.BIN.
      If there is one, make sure it points to a file in the track
      If there isn't any, Create a new one in the last (?) data track
  4. Re-assemble iso(s) using -G ip.bin option
  5. Burn second session

For data/data discs:
  1. Burn the audio tracks (may need to add a bunch of empty ones at the beginning? or check for them?)
  2. Do 2 through 3 above
  3. Generate a dummy file for the last data track ?
  4. Re-assemble iso(s) using -G ip.bin option
  5. Burn second session
